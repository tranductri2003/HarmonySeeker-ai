        Function will estimate key based on the chord counts predicted (with not that high accuracy) from the audio.
        All estimated keys are in Ionian modus. The function doesn't estimate the modus (dorian, phrygian, lydian, ...).

        Parameters
        ----------
        chord_counts : dictionary, key: int, value: int
            dictionary of chord counts in the song, a key indicates the chord index, a value indicates its count in the audio
